## 📊 What We Built

### Backend API - Project Management (5 new endpoints)

1. **GET /api/projects** - List user's projects
   - Pagination support
   - User ownership filtering
   - Returns project metadata

2. **POST /api/projects** - Create new project
   - Validation for all fields
   - Tech stack as JSON array
   - Architecture type enum
   - Code style preferences (JSON)

3. **GET /api/projects/:id** - Get single project
   - Ownership verification
   - Full project details

4. **PUT /api/projects/:id** - Update project
   - Partial updates supported
   - Validation on all fields

5. **DELETE /api/projects/:id** - Delete project
   - Ownership verification
   - Cascades to related analyses

### Backend API - Analysis History (4 new endpoints)

1. **GET /api/analyses** - List user's analyses
   - Filter by project_id
   - Pagination support
   - Project expansion (joins)
   - Preview-only data for list view

2. **GET /api/analyses/:id** - Get full analysis
   - Complete analysis details
   - Scores, reports, refactored code
   - Related project information

3. **DELETE /api/analyses/:id** - Delete analysis
   - Ownership verification

4. **GET /api/analyses/stats** - Get statistics
   - Total analyses count
   - Average scores (total, reliability, mastery)
   - Score trend (improving/declining/stable)
   - Project filtering support

### Backend API - Enhanced Analysis

**Updated: POST /analyze**
- Now accepts optional `project_id` parameter
- Fetches project context from database
- Injects context into AI prompts:
  - Project name and description
  - Tech stack
  - Architecture type
  - Code style preferences
- Automatically saves analysis to database
- Returns `analysis_id` for future reference

### Database Schema (PocketBase)

Created two new collections with migrations:

**`projects` collection:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid (auto),
  name: string (1-200 chars, required),
  description: text (0-2000 chars),
  stack: json array,
  architecture_type: select (monolith, microservices, serverless, modular_monolith, other),
  code_style: json object,
  user_id: relation → users (cascade delete),
  created: datetime,
  updated: datetime
}

// Rules:
listRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"
viewRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"
createRule: "@request.auth.id != \"\""
updateRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"
deleteRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"

// Indexes:
- idx_projects_user ON projects(user_id)
```

**`analyses` collection:**
```javascript
{
  id: uuid (auto),
  user_id: relation → users (cascade delete, required),
  project_id: relation → projects (cascade delete, optional),
  prompt: text (1-10000 chars, required),
  code: text (1-100000 chars, required),
  scores: json (total_score, reliability_score, mastery_score, explanation_summary),
  reports: json (clarity, modularity, efficiency, security, documentation),
  refactored_code: text (0-100000 chars),
  roadmap: json array,
  created: datetime,
  updated: datetime
}

// Rules:
listRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"
viewRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"
createRule: "@request.auth.id != \"\""
updateRule: null (immutable after creation)
deleteRule: "@request.auth.id = user_id"

// Indexes:
- idx_analyses_user ON analyses(user_id)
- idx_analyses_project ON analyses(project_id)
- idx_analyses_created ON analyses(created)
```

### AI Service Enhancement

**Updated AI Prompt Templates:**
All three prompts now accept `{project_context}` placeholder:

```python
{project_context}  # Injected when available

Project Context:
- Name: My Flask App
- Description: E-commerce backend
- Stack: Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Architecture: microservices
- Code Style Preferences: {"indentation": "spaces", "naming": "snake_case"}

Given this project context, please provide analysis that aligns with...
```

This ensures AI provides:
- Tech-stack-specific recommendations
- Architecture-appropriate patterns
- Style-consistent refactoring

### Frontend - Complete SPA Rebuild

**New Architecture:**
```
static/
├── index.html              # Main entry point
├── css/
│   └── main.css           # Unified dark theme stylesheet
└── js/
    ├── app.js             # Route registration & initialization
    ├── auth.js            # Authentication service (singleton)
    ├── router.js          # Client-side router (SPA navigation)
    ├── api.js             # Backend API client (fetch wrapper)
    └── pages/
        ├── auth.js        # Login/signup page
        ├── dashboard.js   # Projects overview & stats
        ├── project.js     # Project detail & analysis history
        ├── analyze.js     # Code analysis interface
        └── project-setup.js # Project creation wizard (placeholder)
```

**Key Frontend Features:**

1. **Client-Side Routing**
   - No page reloads
   - Browser history support
   - Dynamic route matching (e.g., `/projects/:id`)
   - Protected routes (redirect to /auth if not logged in)

2. **Authentication Service**
   - Singleton pattern
   - Token persistence in localStorage
   - Automatic user initialization on load
   - Dynamic UI updates (show/hide user info)
   - Session expiration handling

3. **API Client**
   - Centralized fetch wrapper
   - Automatic Authorization header injection
   - 401 handling (auto-redirect to login)
   - Error handling with structured messages

4. **Dashboard Page**
   - Statistics cards (total analyses, avg score, trend)
   - Project grid with cards
   - Project creation modal
   - Delete functionality with confirmation
   - Empty state handling

5. **Project Detail Page**
   - Project metadata display
   - Analysis history list
   - Score badges for each analysis
   - View/delete actions
   - Project-specific statistics

6. **Analyze Page**
   - Project selector (dropdown)
   - Prompt and code inputs
   - Real-time analysis
   - Results display:
     - Score cards
     - Summary and debug prognosis
     - Five detailed reports
     - Refactored code
     - Architectural roadmap

7. **Modern UI/UX**
   - Dark theme (consistent with MVP)
   - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
   - Loading states with spinners
   - Error boundaries
   - Form validation
   - Modal dialogs
   - Smooth transitions

### Flask App Updates

**Integrated Static File Serving:**
```python
# app/__init__.py updates:
- Added static_folder configuration
- Root route (/) now serves index.html
- Catch-all route for SPA routing
- API routes prefixed with /api (except /auth and /analyze for compatibility)
```

**Route Organization:**
- `/` → Serves SPA entry point
- `/auth/*` → Authentication endpoints
- `/analyze` → Code analysis (backward compatible)
- `/api/projects/*` → Project CRUD
- `/api/analyses/*` → Analysis history
- `/api/health` → Health check

### Codebase Cleanup

**Removed Redundant Files:**
- ❌ `index.html` (root) → Moved to `static/index.html`
- ❌ `app.js` (root) → Replaced with modular `static/js/`
- ❌ `style.css` (root) → Moved to `static/css/main.css`
- ❌ `auth.html` (root) → Integrated into SPA routing
- ❌ `auth.js` (root) → Rewritten as auth service
- ❌ `flask.log` → Removed log file
- ❌ `pocketbase_0.22.0_linux_amd64.zip` → Removed archive

**Current Clean Root Structure:**
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Incremental Development:** Building on auth foundation made this smooth
2. **PocketBase Relations:** Cascade deletes saved a lot of cleanup logic
3. **SPA Architecture:** Client-side routing improves UX dramatically
4. **Context Injection:** Simple string interpolation, huge value

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Frontend Routing:** Needed catch-all route in Flask for SPA deep links
2. **API Prefix Consistency:** Standardized on `/api/*` for new endpoints
3. **State Management:** Singleton pattern for auth service works well

### Technical Debt Created
1. **No Test Coverage:** Need to add integration tests
2. **Error Handling:** Some edge cases not covered
3. **Migration Rollbacks:** Haven't implemented down migrations yet
4. **Frontend State:** No global state management (could use Vue/React later)
