4. **Pagination:** Comparison limited to 2 analyses (could expand to N)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Comparisons:**
   - Compare 3+ analyses
   - Timeline view of improvements
   - Graph of score trends

2. **Better Code Diffs:**
   - Syntax-highlighted diffs
   - Line-by-line comparison
   - Inline diff markers

3. **Export Options:**
   - PDF with charts/graphs
   - JSON export for API integration
   - CSV for data analysis

4. **Collaboration:**
   - Share analysis links
   - Team comments
   - Approval workflows

4. **Query parameters are powerful** - Enable deep linking and sharing

### Product Insights
1. **Users want to track progress** - Comparison is a core value feature
2. **Context matters** - Project info should be visible everywhere
3. **Progressive disclosure works** - Tabs reduce cognitive load
4. **Export enables sharing** - Let users show their work to others
