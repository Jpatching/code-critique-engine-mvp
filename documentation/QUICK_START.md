## 🎉 WEEK 1 PROJECT CONTEXT SYSTEM COMPLETE!

### What We Just Built ✅
**Project-aware code analysis platform is now live:**

**Days 1-2: Authentication ✅**
- ✅ User signup and login
- ✅ JWT token authentication with PocketBase
- ✅ Protected API routes

**Days 3-5: Project Context System ✅**
- ✅ User projects CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Project configuration (tech stack, architecture type, code style)
- ✅ Context-aware AI analysis (prompts include project details)
- ✅ Analysis history with project association
- ✅ Complete SPA frontend with routing
- ✅ Dashboard with project cards and statistics
- ✅ Multi-page architecture (auth, dashboard, project view, analyze)

### Test It Now!
1. **Start services** (see below)
2. **Open** http://127.0.0.1:5500/ (via Live Server)
3. **Sign up** with any email/password (REQUIRED - auth enforced!)
4. **Create a project** with your tech stack
5. **Analyze code** with project context
6. **View your analysis history!**

**⚠️ Note:** You MUST sign up or log in before using any features. Authentication is enforced at multiple levels (frontend routing, API client, backend decorators). See `AUTHENTICATION_FLOW.md` for details.

## 🎯 Week 1 Development Progress

### Day 1-2: Authentication System ✅ COMPLETED!
**Goal:** Users can sign up and log in

#### Backend Tasks ✅
1. ✅ Created auth endpoints in `app/api/auth.py`:
   - ✅ `POST /auth/signup` - Register new user
   - ✅ `POST /auth/login` - Login and get JWT token
   - ✅ `GET /auth/me` - Get current user profile
   - ✅ `PUT /auth/me` - Update user profile
   - ✅ `POST /auth/logout` - Logout endpoint
   - ✅ `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh

2. ✅ Added JWT middleware with `@require_auth` decorator:
   - ✅ Verify tokens on protected routes
   - ✅ Extract user info from requests
   - ✅ Proper error handling (401 Unauthorized)

3. ✅ Updated PocketBase service:
   - ✅ `create_user()` - User registration
   - ✅ `authenticate_user()` - Login
   - ✅ `verify_token()` - Token validation
   - ✅ `update_user()` - Profile updates
   - ✅ `refresh_auth_token()` - Token refresh

4. ✅ Added validation in `app/utils/validation.py`:
   - ✅ Email format validation
   - ✅ Password strength requirements
   - ✅ Password confirmation matching
   - ✅ XSS protection

#### Frontend Tasks ✅
1. ✅ Created `auth.html` with beautiful login/signup forms:
   - ✅ Tab-based interface
   - ✅ Password strength indicator
   - ✅ Real-time validation
   - ✅ Loading states and error messages
   
2. ✅ Built `auth.js` for form handling:
   - ✅ Token management with localStorage
   - ✅ Automatic redirect after auth
   - ✅ Error handling and user feedback
   
3. ✅ Updated `app.js` with auth state management:
   - ✅ Check auth status on page load
   - ✅ Dynamic navigation rendering
   - ✅ User profile dropdown
   - ✅ Logout functionality
   
4. ✅ Updated `index.html`:
   - ✅ Dynamic auth navigation
   - ✅ "Login" and "Signup" buttons
   - ✅ User menu when authenticated

**Test Results:** ✅ ALL PASSED
- ✅ User can sign up with email/password
- ✅ User can log in and receive JWT token
- ✅ Token is stored in localStorage
- ✅ Protected routes require authentication
- ✅ Invalid credentials return proper errors
- ✅ User data persists across page loads

### Day 3-5: Project Context System 🎯 NEXT UP!
**Goal:** Users can define their project architecture

---

### Day 3-5: Project Context System
**Goal:** Users can define their project architecture

#### Backend Tasks
1. Create `projects` collection in PocketBase:
```javascript
{
  name: "My Project",
  description: "E-commerce platform",
  stack: ["React", "Node.js", "PostgreSQL"],
  architecture_type: "microservices",
  code_style: {
    naming: "camelCase",
    formatting: "prettier",
    patterns: ["repository", "dependency-injection"]
  },
  user_id: "relation:users",
  created: "datetime"
}
```

2. Create project endpoints in `app/api/projects.py`:
   - `POST /projects` - Create new project
   - `GET /projects` - List user's projects
   - `GET /projects/:id` - Get single project
   - `PUT /projects/:id` - Update project
   - `DELETE /projects/:id` - Delete project

#### Frontend Tasks
1. Create `project-wizard.html` - 3-step setup form:
   - Step 1: Project name & description
   - Step 2: Stack selection (checkboxes)
   - Step 3: Architecture type & patterns

2. Create `dashboard.html`:
   - Show user's projects as cards
   - "Create New Project" button → wizard
   - Recent analyses list

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] User can create project with wizard
- [ ] Project shows in dashboard
- [ ] User can edit project details
- [ ] User can delete project

---

### Day 6-7: Multi-Page Routing
**Goal:** Transform from single page to multi-page app

#### Implement Simple Routing
Create `router.js`:
```javascript
const routes = {
  '/': 'index.html',           // Landing page
  '/login': 'auth.html',       // Auth page
  '/dashboard': 'dashboard.html', // User dashboard
  '/project/:id': 'project.html', // Project view
  '/analyze': 'analyze.html'      // Analysis interface
};

// Handle navigation without page reload
function navigate(path) {
  // Update URL, load content, update nav
}
```

#### Page Structure
```
/                   - Landing page (new hero section)
/login              - Login/signup forms
/dashboard          - User's projects + recent analyses
/project/:id        - Single project with analysis history
/analyze?project=id - Code analysis interface (improved)
```

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Navigation works without page reload
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to /login
- [ ] URL parameters are parsed correctly

---

- [ ] Keep todo list in sync with actual progress

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### PocketBase Issues
```bash
# If PocketBase won't start
rm -rf pb_data/data.db  # WARNING: Deletes all data
./pocketbase serve

# If collections are missing
# Visit http://127.0.0.1:8090/_/ and create them manually
```

### Flask Issues
```bash
# If server won't start
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key"
python3 server.py

# If imports fail
# Make sure you're in project root and venv is active
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# If Live Server won't start
# Install "Live Server" extension in VS Code
# Right-click index.html → "Open with Live Server"

# If CORS errors occur
# Check Flask CORS configuration in app/__init__.py
```

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### How to Update Documentation
After each development session:

1. **Update `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`:**
   - Mark completed tasks
   - Document any issues encountered
   - Update system status

2. **Update `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`:**
   - Check off completed items
   - Adjust timeline if needed
   - Add any new technical details

3. **Never create new documentation files**
   - All updates go into existing 3 docs
   - Keep everything consolidated

### Daily Standup Format
```
✅ Yesterday: Completed auth endpoints, created login UI
🎯 Today: Build project wizard, set up PocketBase collections
🚧 Blockers: Need clarification on JWT refresh token strategy
```

---

## 🎯 Remember the Goal

**We're building a product people will pay for.**

Every feature should answer:
- Does this help users write better code?
- Does this show improvement over time?
- Does this solve the "vibe coding slop" problem?
- Would I pay $19/month for this?

If not, reconsider the priority.

## 🚀 Let's Build!

**Current Status:** ✅ Clean codebase, clear roadmap, working MVP  
**Next Milestone:** Week 1 - Authentication & Project Context  
**Timeline:** 8 weeks to revenue-generating product

Run `./verify_system.sh` to confirm everything is ready, then start building!
